# Mini-CSH
This is a "mini" version of csh

The Goal of this project is to make a "short" version of CSH. I code builtin like the command "cd" or "setenv/unsetenv".
It can support redirection ('>'), double redirection ('>>'), sepperator (';'), etc.


This project was carried out as part of my apprenticeship at EPITECH
